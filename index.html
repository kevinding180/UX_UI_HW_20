      <h1>Kevin Ding</h1>
      <p>As a UX designer with a background in game design and development, I bring a unique perspective to user experience design. My understanding of game mechanics and player engagement allows me to create designs that not only solve real problems but also engage and delight users. My skills in user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing are paired with a deep understanding of Unity, Unreal Engine, and other game engines. I am also proficient in design tools such as Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma. I strive to create designs that are not only functional but also immersive and enjoyable for the end-users. My ultimate goal is to create experiences that are not only useful but also enjoyable, memorable and emotionally engaging.</p>

      <h3>User-Centered Design</h3>
      <p>A UX designer should have a deep understanding of user behavior and be able to apply that understanding to create user-centered designs that are intuitive, accessible, and easy to use. This means conducting user research, creating personas and user journeys, and testing designs to ensure they meet the needs of users.</p>

      <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
      <p>A UX designer should have strong skills in interaction design, which is the design of the interactions between users and digital products. This requires a deep understanding of human-computer interaction principles and the ability to design interfaces that are intuitive and engaging for users. A good interaction designer can create interfaces that are easy to use, and are accessible to people with disabilities.</p>

      <h3>Visual Design</h3>
      <p>Visual design is an essential component of UX design and is concerned with the look and feel of digital products. A UX designer with strong visual design skills is able to create aesthetically pleasing interfaces that are both functional and attractive. This includes creating wireframes, prototypes, and visual design comps that demonstrate how a product will look and function. Good visual design skills also include a solid understanding of color theory, typography, and layout principles.</p>

        <h4>Fit Match</h4>
        <p>As a part of a UX design team, I played a key role in the development of FitMatch - a cutting-edge mobile application that streamlines the process of putting together stylish and weather-appropriate outfits. The app addresses the common challenge of busy schedules and unpredictable weather, making it difficult for individuals to plan their outfits.With the implementation of real-time weather forecasts and on-demand stylist services, FitMatch transforms the experience of getting dressed into an enjoyable and interactive one. Our team employed user-centered design principles and a user-friendly interface to create an intuitive and easy-to-use app that helps users effortlessly coordinate outfits that are both fashionable and weather-suitable.</p>
